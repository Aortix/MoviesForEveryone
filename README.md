# MoviesForEveryone

**Created using React, Redux, and Express.js**

Website for searching for movies that you may want to watch based off the filters that you set!  Click on each movie to see more information about it!

If you want to use this project and add more code to it, then you'll need to create a .env file with the following structure: 

<Code>TMDB_API_KEY="API key from The Movie Database API (TMDb)"</Code>

You can get your own key from them on their website -> https://<span></span>developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
